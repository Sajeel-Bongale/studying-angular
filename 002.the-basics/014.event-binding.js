    We now want to react to events generated by the user such as a button click. We have a button in the DOM
    which is initially disabled but gets enabled after 2 seconds.

    We will create a new string called serverStatus variable and set it to a default value.

    We will also create a new method called onCreateServer which will be called when the user clicks the create
    new server button.

    Now to bind the events we use the syntax Angular offers us, event binding which uses parentheses,
    like property binding used square brackets, for events parentheses are the signal that we're using event binding.
    We have to specify the name of the event between the parentheses, which will be click.

    Then to it we will attach the function name which we want executed when the click happens which is onCreateServer.

    You can basically bind to all the events made available by the HTML attribute you're placing this on.
    So if you have onClick, onMouseEnter, you could bind to click mouse enter without the on at the beginning.

    You can also execute code within the quotes instead of a function call but that is not the usual convention.
    You should also never add too much code in the quotes if you are still doing so.
