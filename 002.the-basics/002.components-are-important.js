    Components are a key feature of Angular.
    You build your whole application by composing it from several components which you create on your own.

    Now we do start with the app component, the root component which holds entire application. This root component
    will be the component where we later nest or add our other components too.

    Each component has its own template, its own HTML code, maybe its own styling and more importantly also,
    its own business logic. It allows you to split up your complex application, your complex webpage into
    reusable parts. You may use a component more than once and that allows you to easily replicate that
    business logic in many places, not just one.
