    What are directives?
    Directives are instructions in the DOM and we actually already use directives without knowing it.
    Components are kind of such instructions in the DOM. Once we place the selector of our component somewhere
    in our templates, at this point of time we're instructing Angular to add the content of our component template
    and the business logic in our TypeScript code in this place where we use the selector.

    Components are directives with a template. There are also directives without a template.

    Typically we use the attribute selectors when creating directives, but we could also use the other selectors
    just as those mentioned for Component selectors in 009.fully-understanding-the-component-selector.js
