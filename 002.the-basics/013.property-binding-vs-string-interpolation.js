    When should you use which of the two?
    Basically if you want to output something in your template, print some text to it, use string interpolation.
    If you want to change some property, be that of a HTML element or as you will later learn, of a directive or
    a component, typically use property binding.

    Ensure that you do not mix property binding and string interpolation:
    The double curly braces are only a part of string interpolation
    The square bracket notation with only the variable name against it is the syntax for property binding
