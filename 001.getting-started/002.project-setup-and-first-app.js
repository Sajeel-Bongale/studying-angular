    We will need NodeJS installed on the system. We will need npm that comes along with NodeJS.

    Along with this, you will need the angular cli installed. For that you need to run the
    npm install -g @angular/cli@latest
    to install the latest version of the cli.

    You are now ready to create your own angular app.

    To do so navigate to the folder where you want to create your app.

    In this folder run ng new my-first-angular-app

    This will generate a new angular project with all the configuration and setup ready to run the app.

    You can cd into the folder and then run ng serve which will bring up the development server.
