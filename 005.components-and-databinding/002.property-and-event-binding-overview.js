    For communication between components we need to be able to send data into a component or receive data from a
    component. Angular of course gives us great tools to implement this flow.

    We can use property and event binding, not only on HTML elements and their native properties and events
    but also on directives. We also did this with ngClass and ngStyle,
    We can also use it on our own components and bind to our own custom properties and custom events.
