    To add types to the values generated by the http client requests you can add the type against the value received
    in a pipe operator or within the subscribe operator.

    However, there is a better approach. You can simply add angular brackets after the get method call and within it
    declare the type of the object you will be receiving as the response. This type declaration gets propagated to the
    pipe and subscribe callbacks and you do not need to declare the types there. You don't need to add Promise
    wrappers to it. You can simply declare the type of object that you will be receiving  directly

    // Here Post is a predefined model, [key: string] identifies any string as the key and its value is Post.
    // You do not need to wrap the result object in a Promise wrapper
    this.http.get<{ [key: string]: Post }>('urlHere')
      .pipe(// code here)
      .subscriber(// code here)
