    Angular provides two different ways of creating forms.

    Template driven approach
    In this, you set up your form in the template and Angular will automatically infer the structure of your form
    for you. It is suitable for small forms of minor complexity.

    Reactive approach
    You define the structure of the form in TypeScript code and then set up the HTML code. Finally, you manually
    connect the two. Using this approach you can fine tune every little piece about your form.
