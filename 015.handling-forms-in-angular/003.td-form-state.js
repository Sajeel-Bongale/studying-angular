    Inside the ngForm object we have access to the state of the form. This includes things like whether the form is
    dirty, touched, valid and its inverse states. It also has the values of individual elements, their element references
    and the states of each individual elements. We can use these states to keep a track of the state of the form so
    that we can show hints, errors and validation messages to the user at runtime.
