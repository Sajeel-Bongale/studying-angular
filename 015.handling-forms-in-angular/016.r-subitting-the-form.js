    To submit a form, you use the same (ngSubmit) listener like you did in the Template Driven approach.
    Here however, we do not need to pass the form as an argument to the submit handler because, the form is itself
    created and available on the typescript file.

    This form object is very similar to that of the NgForm object generated using the local references in the
     Template Driven approach.
